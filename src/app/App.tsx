              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)] mb-4">
                In February 2025, I was in my first semester of college taking an intro to UX class, and for my
                course project I was assigned to build a native dating app prototype with full creative control
                over the concept. I decided to make an app called Icebreaker, where the whole premise was
                incorporating games to help people connect on a deeper level before going out on a date.
              </p>
              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)] mb-4">
                I started doing market research to find direct and indirect competitors, which turned out to be
                harder than I expected. After several creative Google searches, I came across a platform called
                Date Like Goblins, and it was the closest thing to what I was designing. I signed up and created
                a profile, and since I was married, signing up for dating platforms felt a little odd so I put
                it right in my bio that I'm doing UX research for a school project.
              </p>
              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)] mb-4">
                A few days later, I got an email from the founder, Lise, who wanted to team up. Apparently her
                developer at the time had advised her to bring on a UX designer, not just a UI or graphic designer.
                I accepted, started hanging out in the Goblins Discord, and attended the mod meetings for several
                months while development was quiet.
              </p>
              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)]">
                I was very up front and honest about my experience level because I was a first-semester UX student,
                but I also stood my ground with confidence that I could do what I said I could for them. When Lise
                started bringing more people onto the team, I was invited to join their Slack. Once I proved I could
                keep up with the others and they truly started to see my worth, I was officially brought onto the
                team in August 2025 as an equity-only UX consultant with the understanding that school comes first.

                Goblins had been around for about three years by the time I started my semester, but it was still
                in beta with a small, engaged community in Discord, a founder who had built and maintained it with
                a single developer in her spare time, and a clear vision for what it could be. What it didn't have
                was any formal user research — no usability testing, no structured feedback, no data on where users
                were struggling or dropping off, and the platform had never been put in front of a real user and
                watched.

                Lise and even my professor suggested I focus the study on just the scheduling section, but I pushed
                back on that because the scheduling flow wasn't where the biggest friction was. If someone made it
                all the way to scheduling, they'd already survived sign-up, profile creation, the AI profile review,
                and search, and those earlier touchpoints were where the first impressions happened and where the
                biggest risk of drop-off lived.

                Sixteen weeks for the full semester, from study design through analysis and presentation — that

                coding 136 quotes, building an affinity diagram, and creating a stakeholder presentation, and I
                did all of it solo.

                Virtually none. I received a small monthly stipend, but there was no dedicated research budget,
                and I eventually convinced Lise to offer participants a $20 gift card for their time, which was
                a win in itself.

                The two people who were supposed to be my supervisors for work-based learning were both let go

                been looking forward to working closely with them, and suddenly they were gone. Lise took over
                as my supervisor, and I adapted to the change in guidance and leadership.

                I chose moderated sessions because I wanted a more interactive approach focused on qualitative data,

                follow-up questions when something unexpected came up. It was also the most budget-friendly option
                since all I needed was Google Meet and a screen recording.

                I scoped the study to cover the full primary user journey, from creating an account to booking a
                gaming session. That's a lot of ground for a single study, and both Lise and my professor questioned
                whether I should narrow it down. But the platform had never been tested at all, so I wanted to cast
                a wide net, find the biggest pain points wherever they lived, and give the team a real baseline to
                work from.

                This section isn't about the usability study directly but about a separate piece of work I did for
                Goblins that I think says something about how I approach problems.
              </p>
              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)] mb-4">
                Goblins uses an LLM-based system to review and score every user profile before it goes live on the
                platform. The idea is quality control: make sure profiles are genuine, safe, and give other users
                enough signal to decide if they want to connect. When Lise handed me the prompt, I asked her what
                she'd done to test it. She said she hadn't, so I took it over.

              <p className="font-['Source_Serif_4'] text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--ink-soft)] mb-6">
                The original prompt was biased toward extroversion and anecdotal specificity, which meant it rewarded
                storytelling, humor, and high-energy tone while profiles that were calm, values-driven, or
                introspective were scored lower even when they were socially clear and safe. Concise profiles were
                being labeled "underdeveloped" regardless of how coherent they were.

                I expanded the definition of specificity to include values, communication style, emotional boundaries,
                and interaction preferences because not everyone expresses themselves through stories and humor, and
                the scoring system needed to recognize that. I introduced the concept of "emotional predictability"
                as a core metric: can you predict what interacting with this person will feel like?
              </p>

                I facilitated every session myself with a consistent format: participants started from the sign-up
                page and worked through account creation, profile setup, browsing and searching for other users,
                and booking a session. I gave them a premade bio to bypass the LLM review (based on what I'd learned
                in the pilot) and asked them to think out loud throughout.

                One night, I ran sessions back to back from 9 PM to 12:30 AM with only a 15-minute break in between,
                and that's a facilitation boundary I wouldn't repeat because by the end I was running on caffeine

                The biggest surprise was Halfling mode. Goblins has three visibility modes: Normal (photos visible
                to everyone), Goblin (no photos, fully anonymous), and Halfling (photos visible to your connections
                only). I expected some confusion around Halfling, but I wasn't expecting all five participants to
                have roughly the same misread where every single one assumed Halfling worked the opposite way.

                After the sessions wrapped, I watched back through all the recordings, which was about eight hours
                of video, and I extracted every meaningful quote and observation, tagging each one with the
                participant, timestamp, the section or page where it happened, the sentiment, and a potential theme.
                That produced 136 coded quotes.

                been tagging, and eleven clusters emerged. Some were clearly dominant since the Halfling mode
                confusion showed up across all five participants with near-identical language, while others were
                more scattered but still meaningful.

                When I presented the finding, Lise made the case for the current design by referencing the
                dating-app pattern. I pushed back because the lens of dating apps doesn't necessarily apply to
                gamers, who tend to care more about personality and shared interests than appearance. The
                conversation didn't end with full agreement, but it ended with movement since Lise said she'd
                put Halfling mode on ice and pivot to a simpler two-mode system.

                five moderated sessions solo, hand-coded 136 quotes from eight hours of recordings, built a synthesis

                I learned that the most useful research skill isn't any specific method but knowing how to sit with
                data that might be uncomfortable for the people who need to hear it and figure out how to deliver
                it in a way that creates movement instead of defensiveness.

                I also learned that I work well under constraints that would make most people quit since losing both
                supervisors in the first week could've derailed the whole semester, but instead I adapted, kept
                going, and produced work that earned the trust of everyone I collaborated with. I earned where I am
                now, and I'm just getting started.
